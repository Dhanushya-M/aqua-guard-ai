Water conservation is important because fresh water is limited.
Close taps when brushing to save up to 6 liters per minute.
Fixing a leaking tap can save over 500 liters of water per week.
Use bucket baths instead of showers to reduce water usage.
Collect and reuse grey water from washing vegetables for plants.
Report leaks in hostels to administration immediately.
Avoid washing vehicles frequently and use minimal water.
